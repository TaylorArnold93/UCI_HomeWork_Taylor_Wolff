Conclusion: PyCitySchools
1.	While some schools do display a higher budget and higher overall percentage of passing grades. One could say that Charter schools were the overachievers as they have a lower-class size and provide more resources for their students. 

2.	It can be noted that sizes of class and schools have a dramatically well-performed passing than schools that are larger. Looking at the top 5 performing schools, they displayed a trend of all Charter Schools. The bottom performing schools were all larger schools with smaller budget and those were districts. 

3.	As a whole, this data set displayed that Charter schools are definitely out performers to the average district school and this is measured greatly by the budget, resources, student population and just the overall average of the percentage of passing grades in math and reading. This data analysis also helped display the effectiveness of smaller classroom sizes truly have a better opportunity to serving a group of students and being more effective in performance. 

4.	The Charter schools displayed an average passing grade for math and reading of 89-91% and the district schools displayed an average school of a 67%. Larger class sizes and student population can cause a lot of strain on the budget. By creating a small classroom, I find that the district could possibly be able to perform at a better stance.
