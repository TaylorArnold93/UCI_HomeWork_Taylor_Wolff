Python API Homework - What's the Weather Like?


Background

Whether financial, political, or social -- data's true power lies in its ability to answer questions definitively. 

So let's take what you've learned about Python requests, APIs, and JSON traversals to answer a fundamental question:
    "What's the weather like as we approach the equator?"

Now, we know what you may be thinking: "Duh. It gets hotter..."

But, if pressed, how would you prove it?


Data Analysis – WeatherPy & VacationPy


* When looking at the various data sets with API keys. We can see and visualize that the WeatherPy data that was pulled has a correlation within the temperature and aligns with the latitude.

* We can see that the weather has significantly changes when one gets closers to the equator and that the Northern hemisphere is warmer than the Southern hemisphere dependent on the time of year. 

* Also – the latitude and humidity really have not relationship that is strong enough within the higher humidity areas. We also see that the speed of wind is trending at 0 to 15 mph depending on the latitude.
